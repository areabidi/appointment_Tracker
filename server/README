You're building a backend web app to:

Track patient appointments

Allow patients to assign access to caregivers

Display appointments in a calendar

Use MVC architecture

Use SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL) as the database

Run everything locally in VS Code

Host later on Render

You created a folder structure in VS Code that organizes your code following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

MVC Structure:
/server
  /controllers     <-- business logic (e.g. what happens when user logs in)
  /models          <-- database models/schema definitions
  /routes          <-- define your API endpoints
  /middlewares     <-- reusable logic like authentication, error handling
  server.js        <-- main entry point for Express server

This makes your project:

Modular: easier to maintain and extend

Clean: separates concerns (routes, logic, DB)

Scalable: ready for real-world complexity

-----
You ran:

npm init -y


Which created:

package.json — tracks your dependencies and scripts
(this created a file called package.json which keeps track of:What your project is called, What tools (packages) it uses, How to run it)

Later, this will also help you deploy to platforms like Render
----
npm install express dotenv
express: a lightweight web server framework for Node.js
dotenv: allows you to store sensitive data like DB passwords in a .env file
express – This helps us create the actual server.
dotenv – This lets us hide private info (like passwords) in a .env file.
------
Created a Clean Folder Structure (MVC)
We made folders that separate our code into different jobs (this is called MVC architecture):
/server
  ├── controllers     👈 logic for what your app does
  ├── models          👈 where your data lives
  ├── routes          👈 defines what URLs exist (like /login)
  ├── middlewares     👈 helpers like auth checks
  ├── server.js       👈 the file that starts the server
  └── .env            👈 stores private settings like database password
--------
This is the file that starts your backend server.

Code overview:
require('dotenv').config();          // Load environment variables
const express = require('express');  // Import Express
const app = express();               // Initialize Express app

app.use(express.json());             // Parse JSON bodies in requests

// Basic test route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Appointment Tracker backend!');
});

// Start server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});

Why this matters:
Starts your server
Sets up JSON body parsing (important for APIs)
Confirms everything is working with a test route at /
(Created the server.js File: We made the brain of the backend — server.js.
It does this:Starts the server, Accepts requests (like someone visiting your site), Returns a simple response)
-----
node server.js
Which started your server on http://localhost:3000 and let you test it in the browser.

Where We’re Headed Next
🔜 Coming up:

Create your first route, controller, and model

Connect to a SQL database (MySQL or PostgreSQL)

Implement JWT auth

Set up calendar appointment management

Add patient-controlled access sharing

Connect to a frontend (React or other)
💡 TL;DR Summary
What You Did	Why It Matters
Set up folder structure (MVC)	Keeps your app organized and scalable
Initialized Node project	Makes it a working backend project
Installed Express and dotenv	Needed for web server and environment setup
Created and ran server.js	Proved your server works and routes function
----------------------------
Why did we run npm install sequelize sqlite3 inside the server folder?
Imagine your project like a big toolbox.
npm is like a helper robot that goes and fetches tools for you.
Your package.json file is like a list of tools your project needs.
node_modules is the toolbox where all those tools live.

You are working on the backend, which lives inside the server folder.
What happens when you run:
npm install sequelize sqlite3
npm looks at your project list (package.json) in the server folder.
It grabs the tools named Sequelize (helps us talk to the database) and SQLite3 (our actual database).
It puts those tools inside a toolbox folder called node_modules — inside server/.
Now, your backend code can use those tools to do its job!

}
---------------
Awesome! Now that your backend is set up with:

Express server running

Sequelize connected to SQLite database

package.json dependencies installed properly

Here’s what’s next in your backend development:
1. Create Your Models

Define the tables you’ll need in the database. For example:

User model (for patients, drivers, admin, etc.)

Appointment model (date, time, patient ID, driver ID, status, etc.)

You’ll create these as Sequelize models inside your model/ folder.


MODELS:
1. User

What it is:
The main entity representing any user in the system — whether they are a patient, driver, admin, or any combination.

Key fields:
id, name, email, password, etc.

Relations:

Has many UserRole records → a user can have multiple roles (patient, driver, admin).

Has an optional one-to-one relation to Patient (if the user is a patient).

Has many Trip records as a driver.

Has many Appointment records (both as patient and driver via patient link).

2. Role

What it is:
Defines possible roles a user can have, like "patient", "driver", or "admin".

Relations:

Has many UserRole records linking users to this role.

3. UserRole

What it is:
Join table that connects users and roles to allow multiple roles per user.

How it works:
Each record links one user to one role. Together, these define the user’s roles.

4. Patient

What it is:
Holds patient-specific details like date of birth, emergency contact or extra notes

Relations:

Has a one-to-one relation with a User who has the “patient” role.

Has many Trip records (trips involving this patient).

Has many Appointment records.

5. Trip

What it is:
Records a trip where a driver (User) drives a patient.

Relations:

Each trip belongs to exactly one Patient.

Each trip belongs to exactly one User as the driver.

6. Appointment

What it is:
Records an appointment with the doctor.

Relations:

Linked to one Patient.

Optionally linked to one User as the driver (who drove the patient).

Stores details like appointment date, doctor name, and notes.

Summary of relationships:
From Table	To Table	Relationship Type	Purpose
User	UserRole	One-to-many	Assign multiple roles to user
Role	UserRole	One-to-many	Link role to multiple users
UserRole	User/Role	Many-to-one	Bridge table for many-to-many
User	Patient	One-to-one	User is a patient (extra data)
Patient	Trip	One-to-many	Patient has multiple trips
User (Driver)	Trip	One-to-many	Driver drives multiple trips
Patient	Appointment	One-to-many	Patient has multiple appointments
User (Driver)	Appointment	Zero-or-one to many	Driver associated with appointments optionally
Visual (simplified):
User <---- UserRole ----> Role
  |
  |-- Patient (one-to-one)
        |
        |-- Trip (many)
        |     \
        |      \--> Driver (User)
        |
        |-- Appointment (many)
               \
                \--> Driver (User) [optional]


If you didn’t have a UserRole table:
You might try to store roles directly on the user, like a single role column.
But that limits you to only one role per user.
Or you'd have to store roles as a comma-separated string or JSON array, which complicates querying and indexing.



What we did:
Patient links one-to-one with User.
Appointment links many-to-one with Patient.
Trip links many-to-one with Appointment.
Trip links many-to-one with User as Driver (using alias).


-----------------

2. Create Controllers

Controllers hold the logic that handles requests and interacts with models.

Example controller actions:
Register a user, Login a user, Create an appointment, Update appointment status, List appointments for a patient or driver

1. Make a file to connect to the database(file configh/database.js):
database.js = Connects to the Database

📍 Location: server/config/database.js

Think of this as the plug that connects your app to the database.

It sets up the connection using Sequelize and SQLite.

What it does:

Tells your app where the database is (e.g., a file called database.sqlite)

Prepares Sequelize to work with that database

✅ You usually only touch this once unless you change your database setup.



✅ 2. Sync the Models (Create Tables)

📁 Location:
Option 1: Inside server.js (on app start)
Option 2: In a separate file like server/sync.js for one-time syncing
Models are like blueprints for your data:

“This is what a User looks like — they have a name, email, password…”

You already made model files for:

User

Role

Patient

Appointment

Trip

Now you need to tell Sequelize:

“Hey! Go turn those blueprints into real tables in the database!”

You do this in a file called sync.js (you’ll only run this one time or when updating your tables).
server/sync.js

In your terminal, type:

node server/sync.js


This will:
Connect to the database
Read your models
Create real tables (like Users, Appointments, etc.) in the database


Step	            What it means
config/database.js	Set up your database connection
sync.js	            Create your actual tables in the database
controllers/
and routes/     	Add features like login, booking, assigning rides

We could also just make one file that has sync and DB:

Merging them into One File (Optional Style)

You can make one file that:

Connects to the database

Imports all models

Syncs them

✅ Example: server/setupDatabase.js
// setupDatabase.js (or call it syncAndConnect.js)
const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize');

// 1. Connect to SQLite database
const sequelize = new Sequelize({
  dialect: 'sqlite',
  storage: './database.sqlite',
  logging: false,
});

// 2. Define models (or import them from separate files)
const User = require('./models/User');
const Role = require('./models/Role');
const UserRole = require('./models/UserRole');
const Patient = require('./models/Patient');
const Appointment = require('./models/Appointment');
const Trip = require('./models/Trip');

// 3. Sync models — create tables
sequelize.sync({ force: false }) // or alter: true
  .then(() => {
    console.log('✅ Database connected and tables synced!');
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('❌ Sync failed:', err);
  });

module.exports = sequelize;


💡 Why People Keep database.js and sync.js Separate in Bigger Apps:
| Reason         Why                                           
| Flexibility  | You might want to sync tables separately from starting your server |
"🔨 Development	You may want to rebuild the database without restarting the whole app
🚀 Production	You might want to start the server only, without changing the database
🐛 Testing	You can test your database models without running your full web server"
| Cleaner Code | Each file does **one job** (Single Responsibility Principle)       |
| Teamwork     | Makes it easier to test and update parts separately                |


Reminder: 
| Action           | What it does                          | Run with         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Start server** | Makes the app available to users      | `node server.js` |
| **Sync models**  | Builds or updates the database tables | `node sync.js`   |


| Concept            | Meaning                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sequelize.sync()` | Creates or updates real tables in the database from your model code |
| Without `sync()`   | Your models exist in code only — nothing is stored in the database  |
| Like...            | Telling the builder to use your blueprints and start building!      |

do not manually write SQL commands like:
CREATE TABLE Users (...);
Because you're using Sequelize, which is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), it writes those SQL commands for you, automatically, based on the models you define in JavaScript.


3. Set Up Routes

Create route files (in a routes/ folder) to expose API endpoints.

Example:

POST /users/register — register new user

POST /users/login — login user

GET /appointments — list appointments

POST /appointments — create appointment

server/routes/userRoutes.js
| Line                        | What it Does                                                    |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `express.Router()`          | Creates a mini Express app for grouping related routes          |
| `/register` + `POST`        | Listens for new user registrations (with name, email, password) |
| `/login` + `POST`           | Listens for login attempts (email + password)                   |
| `/` + `GET`                 | Returns a list of all users (optional, for admin/debug)         |
| `UserController.function()` | Calls the logic we’ll define next in the controller             |
| `module.exports = router`   | Makes the routes available to the main app (`server.js`)        |







4. Implement Authentication

Use something like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to handle user authentication and protect your routes.

Users log in and receive a token.

Token is sent with requests to authorize access.


We need this to securely store passwords.
npm install bcrypt




5. Test Your API

Use tools like Postman or Insomnia to test your API routes.

6. Move to Frontend

Once backend APIs are working, start building the frontend UI to connect with your backend.
